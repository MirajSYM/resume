            <strong>Title: Education’s Impact on Employment in Malaysia</strong><br>
            I was assigned to complete this project under the supervision of Professor Azlan bin Mohd Zain, along with
            the
            guidance of Madam Rozita and Madam Laily, as an intern data analyst and BI developer. I had to present the
            progress weekly in front of the organization’s director as well as the team.

            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>1. Ask:</strong>
            <br>
            The first and foremost part of conducting any data analysis is to know "What are you trying to answer?" and
            "Why are you trying to answer them?" I received a lot of questions from my supervisor, and some of them are:
          <ol>
            <li>How has education impacted the employability of Malaysia from 2010 until 2019?</li>
            <li>What level of study has higher rates of employability?</li>
            <li>Male or female, which gender leads the number of employments?</li>
            <li>Which types of jobs are more popular among Malaysians?</li>
            <li>Which state has the highest employability rates?</li>
            <li>Being a multi-racial country, which race leads in terms of being employed?</li>
            <li>Do uneducated people remain unemployed?</li>
            <li>Which year has the highest employed and unemployed numbers?</li>
          </ol>
          The answer to these questions will eventually reflect the "what" and "why" of the asking phase.
          <br>


          <br>
          <strong>2. Prepare:</strong>
          <br>
          Research was conducted with the aim of finding a solution to a problem. In order to address the concerns and
          questions of the stakeholders involved, various sets of data pertaining to employment were gathered and
          analyzed. The chosen tools for this research were Microsoft Excel and PowerBI, as they are the main tools used
          by the organization. To ensure data security and facilitate collaboration, the selected data was stored in
          Google Drive, allowing for backup and easy sharing when needed.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>3. Process:</strong>
          <br>
          The primary data source utilized in the research was data.gov.my, which is a reliable and trusted data store
          maintained by the government. In order to ensure the quality and reliability of the data, a thorough data
          quality check was conducted. Through this check, any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the data were
          successfully
          identified and addressed, ensuring that the data used in the research was accurate and reliable.

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>4. Analyze:</strong>
          <br>
          To create a comprehensive narrative, the multiple data sets gathered were combined into a single, large
          dataset.
          This consolidation allowed for a holistic view of the information and facilitated the development of a
          comprehensive story.
          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>5. Share:</strong>

          <br>
          The combined dataset was then integrated into PowerBI, a powerful data visualization tool.
          Using PowerBI, a dynamic dashboard was created to present the data in an interactive and visually appealing
          manner. The dashboard was designed to address and resolve all the queries and concerns of the stakeholders,
          providing them with a clear and insightful understanding of the data.

          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Insights:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>From 2010 to 2019, the employment statistics were as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>Employed: Approximately 13,702,660 people.</li>
                <li>Unemployed: Approximately 8,843,900 people.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Certificate-wise, individuals with a minimum SPM certification had better employment prospects.</li>
            <li>In terms of gender, males dominated with a percentage of 62.35% compared to females.</li>
            <li>Among the major ethnic groups in Malaysia, Bumiputera individuals had a higher success rate in obtaining
              employment compared to other ethnicities.</li>
            <li>Approximately 14.5% of the workforce comprised non-Malaysian individuals.</li>
            <li>The most preferred job sectors for people were service and sales occupations.</li>
          </ol>

          In summary, the employment statistics in Malaysia from 2010 to 2019 showed a significant number of employed
          individuals and a notable gender imbalance with males dominating the workforce. Individuals with a minimum SPM
          certification had better employment prospects, and Bumiputera individuals had a higher success rate in
          obtaining
          employment. Non-Malaysian individuals constituted a small percentage of the workforce, and service and sales
          occupations were the most preferred job sectors. These insights provide valuable information about the
          dynamics
          of employment in Malaysia.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Remarks:</strong>

          <br>
          The project was highly successful and received recognition from both my organization and the University of
          Technology Malaysia, who showcased it on their official websites.
          <br>


          <br>
          Working under the guidance of Professor Dr. Azlan Mohd Zain had a profound impact on me, solidifying my
          interest
          in pursuing data analysis as a future career goal.
