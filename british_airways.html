            <h3>Task 1: Customer Satisfaction Analysis</h3>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> I was an intern at a company that was interested in learning more about
              customer
              satisfaction with their airline. My role was to help with the data collection and analysis of customer
              reviews.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p><strong>Task:</strong> My main task was to collect and analyze customer reviews from the website Skytrax.
              I
              was specifically interested in reviews that mentioned the airline itself. I collected as much data as
              possible
              to improve the accuracy of my analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> I took the following actions to complete my task:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Used the Python code in the Jupyter Notebook in the Resources section below to collect data from
                Skytrax.</li>
              <li>Cleaned the data using Python.</li>
              <li>Analyzed the data using Python to identify topics, sentiment, and word clouds.</li>
              <li>Created a PowerPoint slide with visualizations and metrics to summarize my findings.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Result:</strong> My actions resulted in the following results:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collected 3607 customer reviews from Skytrax.</li>
              <li>Cleaned the data and removed any duplicate or incomplete reviews.</li>
              <li>Identified the most common topics in the reviews, as well as the sentiment of each review.</li>
              <li>Created a PowerPoint slide with visualizations and metrics to summarize my findings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some of the key findings from my analysis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The most common topics in the reviews were:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Flight experience</li>
                <li>Customer service</li>
                <li>In-flight entertainment</li>
                <li>Food and beverage</li>
              </ul>

              <li>The sentiment of the reviews were mixed both positive and negative </li>

            <h3>Task 2: Predictive Modeling of Customer Bookings</h3>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> The airline industry is facing increasing competition from low-cost carriers
              and
              online travel agencies. In order to stay ahead of the competition, airlines need to be able to predict
              which
              customers are most likely to book flights. This information can be used to target marketing campaigns and
              to
              improve the customer experience.</p>

            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mirajahmedlearns/british-airlines-virtual-internship-task-2"
              target="_blank" class="custom-link">Explore Task 2 notebook
              here</a>.

            <br>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Task:</strong> The task was to build a predictive model that could identify customers who were
              likely
              to book flights. The model was trained on a dataset of historical customer data, including information
              such
              as
              purchase history, travel preferences, and demographics.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> The following steps were taken to build the predictive model:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cleaned and pre-processed the data.</li>
              <li>Split the data into a training set and a test set.</li>
              <li>Evaluated a variety of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and
                support vector machines.</li>
              <li>Selected the random forest algorithm as the best model based on its performance on the test
                set.</li>
              <li>Fine-tuned the model by adjusting the hyperparameters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Results:</strong> The random forest model achieved an accuracy of 84.68% on the test set. This
              means
              that the model was able to correctly predict whether or not a customer would book a flight 84.68% of the
              time.
            </p>


            <br>
            <p>The model was also able to identify the following features as being important for predicting customer
              bookings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Purchase lead: The number of days between when a customer searches for a flight and when they actually
                purchase it.</li>
              <li>Flight hour: The hour of the day when the flight is scheduled to depart.</li>
              <li>Booking origin: The origin airport for the flight.</li>
              <li>Length of stay: The number of days between the flight departure date and the return date.</li>
              <li>Flight day: The day of the week when the flight is scheduled to depart.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--End of the Embed-->

            <br>
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The results of this study suggest that it is possible to build a predictive
              model that can identify customers who are likely to book flights. This information can be used to target
              marketing campaigns and to improve the customer experience. In addition to the features identified in this
              study, there may be other factors that can influence customer booking behavior. These factors could
              include
              the price of the flight, the availability of seats, and the customer's travel preferences. Future studies
              could explore the impact of these factors on customer booking behavior.</p>
